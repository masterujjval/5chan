# ðŸŒ¸ 5chan CLI: Own the Signal

## ðŸ“‹ Description
<strong>Peer-powered. No middlemen. No mercy.</strong>

Spin up your own server â€” you're the host, you're the firewall, you're the last line.
Messages are end-to-end encrypted using a shared symmetric key, because trust isnâ€™t outsourced.

You and your peer share the key. No key, no decrypt. Just silence.
Welcome to 5chan. Speak freely, but bring your own cipher.

No key? No problem â€” fall back to plaintext and whisper into the void like itâ€™s 1999.
