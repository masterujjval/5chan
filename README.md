# 🌸 5chan CLI: Own the Signal

## 📋 What is this tool all about?
<strong>Peer-powered. No middlemen. No mercy.</strong>

♔ Spin up your own server — you're the host, you're the firewall, you're the last line.
Messages are end-to-end encrypted using a shared symmetric key, because trust isn’t outsourced.⛓

♔ You and your peer share the key. No key, no decrypt. Just silence.

♔ No key? No problem — fall back to plaintext and whisper into the void like it’s 1999.

<strong>Welcome to 5chan. Speak freely, but bring your own cipher.🕵️</strong>
